git init:
This command turns a directory into an empty Git repository. This is the first step in creating a repository. After running git init, adding and committing files/directories is possible.

git add
Adds files in the to the staging area for Git. Before a file is available to commit to a repository, the file needs to be added to the Git index (staging area). There are a few different ways to use git add, by adding entire directories, specific files, or all unstaged files.

git commit
Record the changes made to the files to a local repository. For easy reference, each commit has a unique ID.

git status
This command returns the current state of the repository.

git config
With Git, there are many configurations and settings possible. git config is how to assign these settings. Two important settings are user user.name and user.email. These values set what email address and name commits will be from on a local computer. With git config, a --global flag is used to write the settings to all repositories on a computer. Without a --global flag settings will only apply to the current repository that you are currently in.


git branch
To determine what branch the local repository is on, add a new branch, or delete a branch.

git checkout
To start working in a different branch, use git checkout to switch branches.
